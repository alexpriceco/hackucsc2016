		    <span>You have the right to request an OSHA, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, inspection and speak to the inspector.
			OSHA prioritizes inspections based on:
				Imminent dangerous situations
				Severe illnesses and injuries
				Worker complaints
				Referrals of hazards from other federal, state or local agencies, individuals, organizations or the media
				Targeted inspections—inspections aimed at specific high-hazard industries or individual workplaces that have experienced high rates of injuries and illnesses
				Follow-up inspections—checks for abatement of violations cited during previous inspections are also conducted by the agency in certain circumstances.
