        <span class="lesson-info">HUGE VICTORY. ALL associates will get raises this Feb. 20!
Last year Walmart announced increasing minimum pay to $9 / hour but it wasn't enough and many long term associates didn't get anything. After pressure from Walmart workers and community supporters, Walmart has announced this February that ALL associates will be getting a raise and any current associate will be raised up to $10 / hour.
This is a huge step in the right direction. But our fight is not done. We won't stop until ALL associates earn enough to take care of their families.</span>
